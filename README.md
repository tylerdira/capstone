## About
- The goal of this project is to give technicians and the companies they work for an easier way to communicate with their homeowners. This was done by using [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send an email to the homeowner about when the technician would be heading to their property. 

* Ruby version: 2.7.4
* Rails version: 7.0.4
## Setup
 - This application uses a PostgreSQL databse, to start the postreSQL server open your terminal and run \
 `$ sudo service postgresql start`

 - Then after opening the file run \
 `$ bundle install`

 - To start the servers, either open a split terminal or two separate terminals and run \
 `$ rails s` \
 to get the backend server started. Then in your other terminal window run \
 `$ npm start --prefix client` \
 to get the front end started.
